# Ahey (previously Hello)

## A free, p2p, group video call app for the web. No signups. No downloads. Works in all major browsers.

Ahey is built on WebRTC, enabling peer-to-peer video, audio, and text communication. Group calls use a mesh topology, where each participant connects directly to every other participant. This means thereâ€™s no central server handling the media streams, which keeps things private and low-latency, but also makes performance dependent on the number of participants and their internet speeds. Call quality tends to decrease as more people join, with the sweet spot typically being around 6 to 8 participants on a high-speed connection.

### Key Features
