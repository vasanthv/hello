				<h3>Can I create a private channel?</h3>
				<p>
					No, Ahey does not support password-protected or private channels. However, you can use a unique or
					hard-to-guess channel name â€” for example, something like <code>81df86c0-6fb5-4bf3-b6e8-14f5d530edad</code>.
					This makes it highly unlikely that someone will stumble upon your call accidentally.
				</p>

				<h3>How many people can join a channel?</h3>
				<p>
					There is no enforced upper limit on the number of participants in a channel. However, Ahey uses WebRTC mesh,
					which means every participant streams directly to every other participant. Performance depends on your
					bandwidth and device. In practice, it works best with up to around 6-8 people.
				</p>

				<h3>Can I embed Ahey on my website?</h3>
				<p>
					Yes! You can embed any Ahey channel on your website using an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>. Just point the
					source to the desired channel URL. Example:
				</p>
				<pre><code>&lt;iframe
  src="https://ahey.ney/your-channel-here?name=John"
  width="100%"
  height="600"
  style="border:0;"
  allow="camera; microphone; fullscreen; display-capture"
  frameBorder="0"
>&lt;/iframe&gt;
				</code></pre>

				<p>This allows visitors to join your Ahey call directly from your site.</p>
