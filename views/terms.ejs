				<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 16, 2025</p>

				<p>
					Welcome to <strong>Ahey</strong> - a delightfully simple, peer-to-peer video calling service available at
					<a href="https://ahey.net">https://ahey.net</a>. By using this website, you agree to the following whimsical
					yet binding terms:
				</p>

				<h2>Use At Your Own Delightful Peril</h2>
				<p>
					This service is offered strictly on an <strong>"as is"</strong> basis, subject to whimsical change, sudden
					disappearance, or unexpected metamorphosis without prior notice. Think of it as a digital magician's
					disappearing act â€” here one moment, gone the next.
				</p>

				<h2>No Guarantees, No Warranties</h2>
				<p>
					We make absolutely no promises that Ahey will be available, functional, stable, or even awake. It may crash,
					vanish, or otherwise behave unpredictably. That's part of its charm.
				</p>

				<h2>Limited Liability (Extremely Limited)</h2>
				<p>
					The creators of Ahey shall not be held liable for anything that happens while using (or trying to use) this
					service â€” including, but not limited to:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Acts of God</li>
					<li>Rogue asteroids</li>
					<li>Your cat moonwalking across your keyboard</li>
					<li>Existential dread triggered by your own webcam feed</li>
					<li>Unexpected visits from in-laws during a call</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>No Support, No Expectations</h2>
				<p>
					We don't promise support, uptime, or maintenance. If it breaks, it breaks. If it works, hooray! Consider that
					a win.
				</p>

				<h2>Public Channels</h2>
				<p>
					All Ahey video rooms are public by nature. Anyone with the room link can join. Don't share sensitive
					information. If privacy matters, use a hard-to-guess room name â€” but even then, use common sense and caution.
				</p>

				<h2>No Sign-Up, No Account, No Refunds</h2>
				<p>
					Ahey doesn't require a login, doesn't cost anything, and doesn't collect payment. Therefore, no refunds will
					be issued under any circumstance â€” not even for one (1) lost potato.
				</p>

				<h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
				<p>
					These terms may be changed, reversed, rewritten in rhyming couplets, or turned into interpretive dance at any
					moment. By continuing to use the service, you agree to the latest version, whatever that may be.
				</p>

				<h2>Contact</h2>
				<p>
					Questions, praise, or interstellar greetings? Email us at:<br />
