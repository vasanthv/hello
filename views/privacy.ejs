				<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 01, 2025<br /></p>

				<h3>Our Privacy Promise</h3>
				<p>
					Ahey is built with privacy by design. We collect minimal data, store nothing permanently, and use no tracking
					or cookies. Your calls are peer-to-peer, meaning your video and audio go directly between participants, not
					through our servers.
				</p>

				<h3>What Information We Collect</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Your name</strong> - You provide a display name when joining calls</li>
					<li>
						<strong>WebRTC connection data</strong> - Technical data needed to establish peer-to-peer connections (IP
						addresses, connection details)
					</li>
					<li><strong>Access logs</strong> - Basic server logs for technical maintenance and security</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>How We Store Your Information</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Your name</strong> - Stored locally in your browser only, never sent to our servers</li>
					<li>
						<strong>WebRTC data</strong> - Temporarily stored on our servers only while you're connected to a channel
					</li>
					<li><strong>Access logs</strong> - Stored on our servers for 7 days, then automatically deleted</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>When Data Gets Deleted</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Immediately</strong> - WebRTC connection data is deleted as soon as you leave a call</li>
					<li><strong>7 days</strong> - Access logs are automatically deleted after 7 days</li>
					<li>
						<strong>When you clear browser data</strong> - Your stored name is deleted if you clear your browser's local
						storage
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>What We Don't Do</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>No call recording</strong> - We never record, store, or monitor your video/audio calls</li>
					<li><strong>No tracking</strong> - We don't use tracking pixels, or behavioral tracking</li>
					<li><strong>No cookies</strong> - We don't set any cookies on your device</li>
					<li><strong>No data selling</strong> - We never sell, rent, or share your information with third parties</li>
					<li><strong>No permanent accounts</strong> - We don't create user profiles or store account information</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
				<p>Ahey uses minimal third-party services:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Domain hosting</strong> - Our domain and hosting providers may have their own logs</li>
					<li><strong>STUN/TURN servers</strong> - Used to help establish peer-to-peer connections when needed</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Embedded Calls</h3>
				<p>When Ahey is embedded on other websites:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The host website's privacy policy applies to their site</li>
					<li>Ahey's privacy practices remain the same within the embedded frame</li>
					<li>We don't share data with the host website</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Open Source Transparency</h3>
				<p>
					Ahey is open source software. You can review our code, data practices, and privacy implementation at
					<a href="https://github.com/vasanthv/ahey">https://github.com/vasanthv/ahey</a>.
				</p>

				<h3>Data Security</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Encrypted connections</strong> - All data is transmitted over HTTPS</li>
					<li><strong>Peer-to-peer encryption</strong> - WebRTC provides built-in encryption for your calls</li>
					<li><strong>Minimal attack surface</strong> - We store almost no data, so there's little to compromise</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Your Rights</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Access</strong> - You can see what name you've stored by checking your browser's local storage
					</li>
					<li><strong>Delete</strong> - Clear your browser data to remove your stored name</li>
					<li><strong>Portability</strong> - Your name is stored locally and easily transferable</li>
					<li><strong>No profiling</strong> - We don't create profiles, so there's nothing to correct or update</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
				<p>
					Ahey is intended for users 13 and older. We don't knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you
					believe a child has used Ahey, please contact us.
				</p>

				<h3>International Users</h3>
				<p>
					Ahey works globally. Your WebRTC data may be processed in the country where our servers are located, but it's
					deleted immediately when you leave calls.
				</p>

				<h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
				<p>
					We may update this privacy policy. We'll post changes here and update the date above. Continued use means you
					accept any changes.
