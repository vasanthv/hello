				<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 16, 2025<br /></p>

				<p>
					Ahey is a free, peer-to-peer video conferencing app. We care deeply about your privacy and collect only the
					minimum information needed to make video calls work. You can use Ahey without signing up or registering.
				</p>

				<h2>What We Collect</h2>
				<p>
					Ahey does <strong>not</strong> require an account, login, or registration. However, we handle a small amount
					of temporary and technical data to enable video calls.
				</p>

				<h3>We temporarily handle:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>WebRTC ICE candidates</strong>: Used to connect you with other peers in the same channel. These are
						stored in memory on the signaling server <strong>only while you are in a call</strong>, and are
						<strong>deleted immediately</strong> when you leave.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>We store locally:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Name</strong> (if you provide one): This is saved
						<strong>only in your browser's local storage</strong> to identify you during a call. It never leaves your
						device or gets sent to our server.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Access Logs:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Like most web servers, we maintain basic <strong>access logs</strong> (e.g., IP address, time of access,
						user agent) for security and operational reasons. These logs are stored securely and are not used for
						tracking or analytics.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>How Calls Work</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Video and audio streams are handled by <strong>WebRTC</strong>, which connects users
						<strong>directly</strong> in a peer-to-peer mesh.
					</li>
					<li>
						We use <strong>Socket.IO</strong> as a signaling mechanism to exchange ICE candidates and set up the WebRTC
						connections.
					</li>
					<li>
						Once connected, communication happens directly between participants. Our server is not involved in the call
						content.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>We do <strong>not</strong> record, log, or store any video, audio, or chat data.</p>

				<h2>Channel Privacy</h2>
				<p>
					Channels are public and open - anyone with the link can join.<br />
					For privacy, we recommend using a <strong>unique or hard-to-guess channel name</strong>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Example:<br />
					<code>https://ahey.net/team-sync-4x9pzq</code>
				</p>

				<h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
				<p>We do <strong>not</strong> use:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Cookies</li>
					<li>Analytics</li>
					<li>Tracking scripts</li>
					<li>Fingerprinting or profiling</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Data Retention</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>ICE candidates are held <strong>temporarily</strong> and cleared when users leave a call.</li>
					<li>Names remain in your browser's local storage and are never sent to our servers.</li>
					<li>Access logs are kept for a limited period for operational and security reasons, then deleted.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Open Source</h2>
				<p>
					Ahey is a fully <strong>open source</strong> project. You can inspect, audit, or contribute to the code on our
					public repository.<br />
					Repository: <a href="https://github.com/vasanthv/ahey">https://github.com/vasanthv/ahey</a>

				<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
				<p>
					Ahey is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or store data from minors.
				</p>

				<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

					If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we'll update the ‚ÄúEffective Date‚Äù above. Since we don't collect
					your contact info, we can't notify you directly. Please check this page for the latest version.
