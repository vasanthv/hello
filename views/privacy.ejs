					At Ahey, we prioritize your privacy by collecting only the minimal amount of data necessary to ensure a
					seamless user experience. Specifically, we collect:
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>
						<span class="bold">RTCICECandidates</span> & <span class="bold">RTCSessionDescription</span>: These are
						essential for establishing video calls using WebRTC. This data is not stored in any persistent database and
						is removed from the server immediately after you close the browser window.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="bold">Your Name</span>: This is used for identification within the app and is stored locally on
						your browser.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<br />
				<label>Key Points:</label>
				<ul>
					<li>All video chats are 100% peer-to-peer, meaning they never touch our servers.</li>
					<li>Ahey is purely peer-to-peer, ensuring your video is not sent to our server.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The creators of Ahey are committed to never using or selling your personal data.</p>
